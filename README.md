I added a character "Boss" with animation and a gun. I built a level with lights and textures. I tried to add an enemy but could not get it to move. I added an objective which is find the egg. I added some parkour and some exploring necessary to find the egg. The egg has a very interesting texture meant to look alien like or "out of this world". 

Thank you for being so patient with me. I am very grateful for all the extra time you have given me.
